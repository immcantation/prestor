# Quality Scores

Quality filtering is an essential step in most sequencing workflows. pRESTOâ€™s
FilterSeq tool remove reads with low mean Phred quality scores. 
Phred quality scores are assigned to each nucleotide base call in automated 
sequencer traces. The quality score (`Q`) of a base call is logarithmically 
related to the probability that a base call is incorrect (`P`): 
$Q = -10 log_{10} P$. For example, a base call with `Q=30` is incorrectly 
assigned 1 in 1000 times. The most commonly used approach is to remove read 
with average `Q` below 20.
